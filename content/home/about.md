# Biography

Hello everyone! Welcome to my website. I am a 4th year Ph.D student at University of Texas-Austin. I am passionate about approaching problems systematically and solving them using novel approaches. My research interests include wearable computing and mobile healthcare. More specifically, my research works involves leveraging the built-in sensors available in commercial devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, activity trackers, smart water bottles and etc. and using the data collected from the sensors to recognize human activities or any underlying physiological symptoms/conditions that may not be clearly visible or perceptible to us. 

I received a bachelor's degree in Biomedical engineering at University of Wisconsin - Madison. I was advised by Dr. John G. Webster.

is a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. Her research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. She leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.
