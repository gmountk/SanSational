# Welcome !
Hi, my name is San. I am a 4th year Ph.D student at University of Texas at Austin. My research interests lie in wearable computing and mobile healthcare. More specifically, I am interested in leveraging built-in sensors available in commercial devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, activity trackers and etc. to recognize human activities or detect underlying pathophysiological conditions that may not be clearly perceptible to humans. 

I received a bachelor's degree in Biomedical engineering at University of Wisconsin - Madison. At University of Wisconsin-Madison, I worked in Bioinstrumentation Lab and I was supervised by [Dr. John G. Webster](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/display.php/faculty/webster_john?page=bme&search=faculty&item=webster_john). Here at UT, I am in Human Signals Lab and I am surpvised by [Dr. Edison Thomaz](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~ethomaz/).
